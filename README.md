# WizardGrenade2
A shiny new version of WizardGrenade, my worms2 style wizard-battling indie game.
The original version(s) were fun to make, but through on-the-fly development the codebase very quickly became very coupled and cluttered.
This seems like a great opportunity to build up from scratch with a plan, to make a clean, (essentailly!) object-oriented codebase before proceeding further with development.
