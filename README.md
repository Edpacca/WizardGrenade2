# WizardGrenade2
A new improved codebase for my Worms2 style wizard-battling indie game.
The original version was fun to develop and I spent many hours coding and learning as I went.
Being relatively new to development the base class from which all physical objects inherited from became too complex to diesentangle and diseminate into smaller more focusses classes.
This seemed like a great opportunity to build up from scratch and improve the object-orientation and try some new design patterns. 
I am very pleased with the result so far and it has become much easier to work with and add new things to.
Still and work in progress, so artwork will only be uploaded at the end of the project.
