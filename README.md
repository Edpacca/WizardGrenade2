# WizardGrenade2
I challenged myself to complete a more demanding project, to develop a complete game from start to finish within a few months.
I have written the entire physics engine, made destructable terrain and coded all game mechanics from audio settings to brightness control - Wizard Grenade only uses the Monogame game framework to run the game-loop and draw to the screen.
The current iteration of the game is complete, and is in Beta testing within a small community of friends and colleagues.

Wizard Grenade is a turn-based, side-view multiplayer game inspired by Team17's Worms franchise.
Players take it in turns to cast different spells in the form of various projectiles with different effects at each other, until only one team remains.
I have created all the artwork and music, and generated most of the audio and foley work myself - with the exception of the beautiful skies and the moon which are digital drawings by Alicja Przystup.
Check out the GitHub page for a more detailed look into how the game works.
This project has been a lot of fun, and taught me a great deal about object oriented programming and design patterns.
If you have any comments or suggestions to improving the codebase please feel free to get in touch.
If you would like to be part of Beta testing then also let me know and I will add you to the Discord server!
