# WizardGrenade2
A new improved codebase for my Worms2 style wizard-battling indie game.
The original version was fun to develop and I spent many hours coding and learning as I went.
Being relatively new to development I had created a single complex base class from which all physical objects inherited.
It soon became apparent that this should be diseminated into smaller focussed classes, but disentangling it would have been a mammoth task.
This seemed like a great opportunity to build up from scratch and improve the object-orientation and try some new design patterns. 
I am very pleased with the result so far and it has become much easier to work with and add new things to.
Currently a work in progress, so artwork will only be uploaded at the end of the project.
